# Fetch-Rewards-Coding-Exercise

In the Fetch Rewards Analytics Engineer coding exercise, I'll be focusing on four key areas:

1. Structuring Data: I'll review provided JSON files to create a structured, relational data model suitable for a data warehouse. This involves defining tables, their attributes, and relationships.
    Please refer:  1. Relational Data Model Diagram
2. SQL Queries: Using the data model, I'll write SQL queries to address specific business questions, showcasing my ability to extract meaningful insights.
    Please refer:  2. Answer for Predetermined Questions
3. Data Quality: I'll identify potential issues in the data, such as inconsistencies or missing values, to ensure the reliability of analyses.
    Please refer:  3. Data Quality Evaluation
4. Stakeholder Communication: I'll draft a clear and concise message to a non-technical stakeholder, explaining my findings and any data quality concerns.
